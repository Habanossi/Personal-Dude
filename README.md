AI/Robotics/Home automation hobby project, goal would be to have an autonomous mobile robot which also takes speech commands, outputs speech communication and can for example complete home automation tasks. The robot would also have a mapped environment where to move and complete physical tasks.

Aim is also to learn proper version numbering.

## Current version 0.2.0
- no physical robot
- python program which waits for wake-word before doing anything
- gpt wake-word available, waits for a prompt and then gives a maximum 10 word answer in <10 seconds.
- user can quit the program (nice)


## Autonomous mobile robot:
- perception
- path planning
- control
- decision making

## Comms:
- speech to text
- text processing
- commands
- comms as in llm?
- Specific wake-word for Command-mode, another wake-word for LLM-mode
